*The Next Platform* provides in-depth coverage of high-end computing at large enterprises, supercomputing centers, hyperscale data centers, and public clouds. Against the backdrop of the [Supercomputing (SC20)](/spack-at-sc20/) conference, the article titled ["Spack Packs Deployment Boost for Top Supercomputers"](https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/11/12/spack-packs-deployment-boost-for-top-supercomputers/) describes the challenges of creating and deploying scientific software packages. Writer Nicole Hemsoth explains how Spack seeks to fill gaps in customization and configurability; that it is the deployment tool for Fukagu, the worldâ€™s top supercomputer; and, heading into the exascale era, how the Spack development team is handling the growing complexity of dependency issues for HPC software.
